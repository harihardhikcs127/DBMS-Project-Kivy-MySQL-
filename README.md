## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the use of Kivy for creating an interactive GUI that allows users to perform various database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) on a MySQL database. The integration ensures real-time updates, making it ideal for applications that require up-to-date information.

## Features
- **Kivy-based GUI**: A sleek and responsive user interface.
- **MySQL Integration**: Reliable backend database operations using Python MySQL Connector.
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, delete, and retrieve data from MySQL.
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate reflection of database changes in the GUI.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Kivy
- MySQL Server
- Python MySQL Connector
